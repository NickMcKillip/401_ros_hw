## Nick McKillip Ros HW
I've created a catkin workspace and the package nick_package. I also created the custom msg type nick_msg this msg type carries an int 64 a string and an array. I have 2 scripts a talker that publishes the nick_msg to the topic chatter and a listen that receives the msgs on chatter.
